# Design Document

## Overview

Slop Frog is a Chrome extension that adds a lightweight AI-content safety layer to X and LinkedIn. While the user scrolls, the extension extracts visible post text and limited metadata, sends a scoring request through the product workflow, and renders a compact flag directly on the post.

The new hackathon version is no longer a purely local-laptop detector plus Supabase project. That approach was useful for the first build, but the Imbue/Qwen detector is too heavy for reliable MacBook Air inference. The current product direction is:

- **Chrome extension:** user-facing feed layer for X and LinkedIn.
- **Runtype:** product API, workflow orchestration, learning-loop coordination, and eval gates.
- **Modal:** hosted GPU inference for the Imbue/Qwen text detector.
- **InsForge:** backend database, secrets, functions, app data, reviewer reputation, votes, appeals, verdict history, and cleaned training-data metadata.
- **No Cotal:** intentionally omitted because it does not clearly serve the product right now.

The branch that currently makes the most sense for this direction is `modal-imbue-inference`. It already contains the Modal inference work, InsForge project link, Runtype setup notes, and recent extension fixes. The main branch can be updated later after this branch is demo-stable.

The end-state product should be Chrome Web Store installable. A normal user should download Slop Frog, open X or LinkedIn, and get limited safety annotations without running a local model. To control cost, public users never call Modal directly. They call the Slop Frog product API, which checks cache and rate limits before deciding whether to spend a live Modal inference.

## Product shape from the user perspective

The user installs Slop Frog, opens X or LinkedIn, and scrolls normally. Each supported post gets a small control group:

- a colored flag for the Slop Score evidence;
- a feedback icon for community judgment;
- an appeal icon for challenging a label.

The user does not paste posts into a separate app. The user does not read a big explanation beside every post. Slop Frog behaves like a small trust annotation layer inside the feed.

Flag meaning:

- **Red:** high Slop Score.
- **Yellow:** medium or mixed Slop Score.
- **Green:** low Slop Score.
- **Gray:** not enough signal or the detector/workflow was unavailable.

Gray is a system honesty state, not a human-content label.

## Design principles

1. **Scroll-first, not paste-first.** The extension must work in the feed.
2. **Simple labels, inspectable evidence.** The feed shows a flag; details stay one click away.
3. **Contestable by design.** Users can vote and appeal.
4. **Autonomous workflow, human-gated learning.** Runtype can coordinate data cleaning and evals, but model promotion requires gates.
5. **Modal for heavy inference.** Do not force hackathon judges or users to run a huge model locally.
6. **InsForge for backend memory.** Supabase is no longer the target backend.
7. **Privacy-minimized by default.** Store explicit labels and limited metadata, not everyone's entire feed.
8. **No fake confidence.** Unsupported media and insufficient evidence must be visible as gray/unsupported.
9. **UI should feel native.** Compact icons, clean spacing, strong contrast, minimal text.

```

During debugging, the extension may call Modal directly to isolate failures. For product architecture, sponsor alignment, and cost control, the stable public path must be extension -> Runtype -> InsForge quota/cache -> Modal only when allowed.

## Runtime flow

### 1. Platform detection

The content script chooses a platform adapter based on the current URL.

Supported adapters:

- `x`
- `linkedin`

Unsupported sites do nothing.

### 2. Post extraction

The adapter finds visible post containers and extracts:

- platform;
- post URL when available;
- platform post ID when available;
- author handle/name when available;
- visible text;
- normalized text;
- text hash;
- visible image URLs when available;
- timestamp when available;
- extraction timestamp.

The extension does not upload raw media. For LinkedIn, the extension may use text visible in the browser session, but the backend must not scrape LinkedIn later.

### 3. Scoring request

The background worker creates a `Score_Request` and sends it to the Runtype `score_post` endpoint.

If Runtype is unavailable during a local debug run, the extension may use a configured Modal detector URL directly.

### 4. Runtype scoring workflow

Runtype should own the product-level scoring workflow:

1. validate the request shape;
2. identify the user/install tier;
3. check InsForge score cache;
4. check InsForge rate limit when cache misses;
5. call the Modal detector only when quota allows;
6. fetch any available InsForge community aggregate;
7. compute or normalize the Slop Score result;
8. write a verdict-history event when appropriate;
9. return a stable response to the extension.

This makes Runtype useful in a non-stupid way: it is not "another LLM glued on top." It is the orchestration and evaluation layer that coordinates detector calls, community signal, data cleaning, learning workflows, and promotion gates.

### 5. Modal detector

Modal hosts the Imbue/Qwen text detector because local inference was too RAM-heavy for a reliable demo.

Expected endpoints:

```text
GET /health
POST /score
```

Expected `/score` output:

```ts
interface ScoreResponse {
  ok: boolean;
  detectorScore: number | null;
  evidenceCoverage: number;
  labelRecommendation: "red" | "yellow" | "green" | "gray";
  reasons: string[];
  modalityScores: {
    text?: ModalityScore;
    image?: ModalityScore;
    audio?: ModalityScore;
    video?: ModalityScore;
  };
  modelName: string;
  modelVersion: string;
  errorCode?: string;
}
```

If Modal cold-starts or reloads the model, the UI should show a graceful loading/gray state rather than throwing extension errors.

### 6. InsForge backend

InsForge replaces Supabase.

Responsibilities:

- content identity records;
- explicit community votes;
- reviewer quality/reputation;
- appeals;
- verdict history;
- aggregate community scores;
- training-data candidate metadata;
- cleaned dataset batches;
- model registry records;
- eval results;
- backend secrets.

It also owns public-product cost control:

- install or account quota records;
- owner/admin bypass;
- score cache keyed by `content_key`;
- rate-limit decision logs;
- public usage analytics.

The InsForge project currently linked to this directory is:

```text
Project: slop_frog
API base: https://5gubegn5.us-east.insforge.app
```

Do not hard-code service keys in extension code.

## Supabase to InsForge migration

The migration is a schema migration, not a magical database copy.

The practical path:

1. Keep `supabase/schema.sql` as a historical reference.
2. Create a new InsForge migration file using `npx @insforge/cli db migrations new migrate_slop_frog_schema`.
3. Recreate the app-owned tables in InsForge/Postgres:
   - `content_items`
   - `reviewers`
   - `community_votes`
   - `appeals`
   - `verdict_history`
   - `training_candidates`
   - `dataset_batches`
   - `model_registry`
   - `eval_results`
   - `score_cache`
   - `rate_limit_buckets`
   - `rate_limit_events`
4. Normalize naming where useful:
   - `reputation_weight` becomes `quality_weight`;
   - `tweet_id` becomes generic `post_id` because the product now supports X and LinkedIn;
   - raw author handle becomes hashed or optional metadata where possible.
5. Add indexes and constraints around `content_key`, `platform`, `post_id`, `reviewer_id`, and created timestamps.
6. Add RLS/policies or functions so public users can submit feedback/appeals but cannot read private reviewer/admin data.
7. Verify with InsForge SQL queries.

If existing Supabase rows need to be moved later, export them from Supabase, clean them, then import into InsForge tables. For the hackathon, recreating the schema in InsForge matters more than bulk-copying old test data.

## Public rate limiting and cost control

The extension should eventually be installable by anyone, but Modal inference costs money. The design must assume hostile or enthusiastic public usage.

### User tiers

```text
owner_admin:
  unlimited or very high quota for demos and development

public_guest:
  one uncached live Modal inference per rolling 24 hours by default

public_signed_in:
  optional future tier with a slightly higher quota
```

Only the backend can decide tier. The extension may show status, but it cannot be trusted to enforce limits alone.

### Scoring decision order

```text
1. Compute content_key.
2. Check extension session cache.
3. Ask Slop Frog API for score.
4. API checks InsForge score_cache.
5. If cached detector score is fresh, return cached score.
6. If no cache, check quota.
7. If owner/admin, allow Modal.
8. If public user has quota, allow Modal and decrement quota.
9. If quota exhausted, return community-only score if available.
10. If no community signal exists, return gray with reason rate_limited.
```

This means public users can still get value without every post triggering Modal:

- popular posts reuse cached scores;
- posts with community labels can still show a Slop Score;
- unsupported or quota-exhausted uncached posts become gray instead of expensive.

### Required tables

`score_cache`:

```sql
content_key text primary key,
platform text not null,
detector_score numeric,
evidence_coverage numeric,
label text check (label in ('red', 'yellow', 'green', 'gray')),
model_name text,
model_version text,
reasons jsonb,
expires_at timestamptz,
created_at timestamptz default now(),
updated_at timestamptz default now()
```

`rate_limit_buckets`:

```sql
subject_key text primary key,
tier text not null,
window_start timestamptz not null,
window_end timestamptz not null,
used integer not null default 0,
quota integer not null,
updated_at timestamptz default now()
```

`rate_limit_events`:

```sql
id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
subject_key text not null,
content_key text,
tier text not null,
decision text not null check (decision in ('cache_hit', 'live_allowed', 'rate_limited', 'owner_bypass')),
metadata jsonb,
created_at timestamptz default now()
```

`subject_key` should be a privacy-preserving install/account hash, not a raw email or device fingerprint.

## Shared contracts

### `Post_Envelope`

```ts
type Platform = "x" | "linkedin";

interface PostEnvelope {
  platform: Platform;
  contentKey: string;
  postId?: string;
  url?: string;
  authorHandle?: string;
  authorDisplayName?: string;
  visibleText: string;
  normalizedText: string;
  textHash?: string;
  imageUrls?: string[];
  extractedAt: string;
}
```

### `Score_Request`

```ts
interface ScoreRequest {
  post: PostEnvelope;
  settings: {
    evidenceCoverageMinimum: number;
    redThreshold: number;
    yellowThreshold: number;
    includeCommunity: boolean;
  };
}
```

### `Community_Aggregate`

```ts
interface CommunityAggregate {
  contentKey: string;
  voteCount: number;
  communityScore: number | null;
  looksAiWeight: number;
  looksHumanWeight: number;
  unsureWeight: number;
  appealStatus?: "none" | "submitted" | "under_review" | "accepted" | "rejected";
  updatedAt?: string;
}
```

Community scoring:

```text
looks_human = 0
unsure = 50
looks_ai = 100
communityScore = weighted average using reviewer quality
```

### `Slop_Score_Result`

```ts
interface SlopScoreResult {
  contentKey: string;
  label: "red" | "yellow" | "green" | "gray";
  slopScore: number | null;
  detectorScore: number | null;
  communityScore: number | null;
  evidenceCoverage: number;
  reasons: string[];
  modelName?: string;
  modelVersion?: string;
  autoFiltered: boolean;
}
```

### Slop Score calculation

```text
if evidenceCoverage < minimum:
  label = gray
else if detector unavailable:
  label = gray
else:
  if communityScore exists:
    slopScore = detectorWeight * detectorScore + communityWeight * communityScore
  else:
    slopScore = detectorScore

  red if slopScore >= 75
  yellow if 40 <= slopScore < 75
  green if slopScore < 40
```

LinkedIn MVP override:

```text
red if slopScore >= 40
yellow/orange if 20 < slopScore < 40
green if slopScore <= 20
gray if insufficient signal
```

The visible flag must update when a feedback submission changes the Slop Score across a threshold.

## UI design

UI rules live in [`ui.md`](ui.md). The important current requirements:

- controls should sit near the bottom-left/bottom action area without colliding with native buttons;
- flag uses the flag color;
- feedback icon should be white for contrast;
- appeal icon should be white for contrast;
- evidence, feedback, and appeal are separate panels;
- evidence panel must be closable;
- auto-filter is off by default;
- red post blocker must be compact and removable when auto-filter is disabled;
- popup should be polished and not expose noisy developer controls by default.

## Data model

### `content_items`

Stores identity and limited explicitly labeled content metadata.

```sql
content_key text primary key,
platform text not null,
post_id text,
url text,
text_hash text,
text_snapshot text,
author_handle_hash text,
created_at timestamptz default now(),
updated_at timestamptz default now()
```

`text_snapshot` is allowed only for explicit labeled examples and should be cleaned before training use.

### `reviewers`

```sql
reviewer_id text primary key,
display_name text,
quality_weight numeric not null default 0.25,
review_count integer not null default 0,
created_at timestamptz default now()
```

### `community_votes`

```sql
id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
content_key text references content_items(content_key),
reviewer_id text references reviewers(reviewer_id),
vote text not null check (vote in ('looks_ai', 'looks_human', 'unsure')),
reviewer_weight numeric not null,
created_at timestamptz default now()
```

### `appeals`

```sql
id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
content_key text references content_items(content_key),
reviewer_id text references reviewers(reviewer_id),
reason text not null,
status text not null check (status in ('submitted', 'under_review', 'accepted', 'rejected')),
created_at timestamptz default now(),
resolved_at timestamptz
```

### `verdict_history`

```sql
id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
content_key text references content_items(content_key),
event_type text not null,
label text check (label in ('red', 'yellow', 'green', 'gray')),
slop_score numeric,
detector_score numeric,
community_score numeric,
metadata jsonb,
created_at timestamptz default now()
```

### `training_candidates`

```sql
id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
content_key text references content_items(content_key),
source_event text not null,
label text,
cleaning_status text not null default 'pending',
pii_risk text not null default 'unknown',
created_at timestamptz default now()
```

### `dataset_batches`

```sql
id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
status text not null,
candidate_count integer not null default 0,
cleaning_report jsonb,
created_at timestamptz default now()
```

### `model_registry`

```sql
id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
model_name text not null,
model_version text not null,
modal_endpoint text,
eval_status text not null,
promoted boolean not null default false,
metadata jsonb,
created_at timestamptz default now()
```

### `eval_results`

```sql
id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
model_registry_id uuid references model_registry(id),
eval_suite text not null,
status text not null,
metrics jsonb,
created_at timestamptz default now()
```

## Learning loop

The future learning loop should be described as human-in-the-loop detector improvement, not reckless automatic RL.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Votes[Votes + appeals] --> Candidates[Training candidates]
    Candidates --> Clean[PII cleaning]
    Clean --> Batch[Dataset batch]
    Batch --> Train[Fine-tune / LoRA job]
    Train --> Eval[Runtype eval suites]
    Eval --> Review[Human approval]
    Review --> Promote[Modal detector promotion]
```

Runtype's role:

- start the batch-preparation workflow;
- coordinate cleaning checks;
- trigger or track Modal training/eval jobs;
- run eval suites;
- block promotion if evals fail;
- keep a workflow trail for judges.

InsForge's role:

- store labeled candidates;
- store cleaning status;
- store dataset batch metadata;
- store model versions;
- store eval results.

Modal's role:

- run heavy model inference;
- optionally run future fine-tuning/eval jobs.

## Security and privacy

The extension must ask for only the host permissions it needs:

```json
{
  "permissions": ["storage"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://x.com/*",
    "https://twitter.com/*",
    "https://www.linkedin.com/*",
    "https://api.runtype.com/*",
    "https://*.modal.run/*",
    "https://5gubegn5.us-east.insforge.app/*"
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- no `<all_urls>` permission;
- no service keys in extension code;
- no public direct Modal calls;
- no raw media storage;
- no backend LinkedIn scraping;
- no storing every feed item as training data;
- no unlimited public hosted inference;
- explicit user votes and appeals can create training-data candidates;
- training candidates must be cleaned before training use.

## Testing strategy

### Extension checks

- Chrome loads unpacked extension without manifest errors.
- X posts render compact controls.
- LinkedIn posts render compact controls.
- The controls do not collide with native action buttons.
- Evidence panel opens and closes.
- Feedback and appeal open independently.
- Auto-filter is off by default.
- Disabling auto-filter removes current blockers.

### Modal checks

- `GET /health` returns OK.
- `POST /score` returns a valid score response.
- Cold-start or unavailable detector does not create uncaught extension errors.

### Runtype checks

- Product exists.
- `score_post` endpoint accepts fixture payloads.
- `submit_feedback_insforge` endpoint accepts a fixture vote and writes an InsForge vote.
- `submit_appeal_insforge` endpoint accepts a fixture appeal and writes an InsForge appeal.
- Eval suites exist for scoring, detector regression, and privacy cleaning.

### InsForge checks

- Project is linked.
- Database query works.
- Required tables or migrations exist.
- Secrets are stored server-side.
- Vote and appeal writes can be verified.

### Demo checks

- Use branch `modal-imbue-inference`.
- Load extension in Chrome.
- Confirm Modal detector health.
- Open X and show flags.
- Open LinkedIn and show flags if selector stability allows.
- Show public rate-limit behavior: first uncached live inference works, later uncached posts fall back to cache/community/gray.
- Show owner/admin bypass for demos.
- Open evidence panel.
- Submit feedback.
- Submit appeal.
- Turn auto-filter on and hide a red post.
- Turn auto-filter off and confirm blocker disappears.

No task is complete until its verification check has passed.
